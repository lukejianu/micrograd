# micrograd
My implementation of Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

## What I Learned
My goal with this project was to see if I learned enough from [Karpathy's
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0) to implement micrograd
myself. I thought his implementation of backpropagation was strange and tried
to do it without the topological sort (using recursion instead). It
turns out there were good reasons he did it the way he did...
